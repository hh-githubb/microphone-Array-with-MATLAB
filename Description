 Assumption of the problem: the number of 10 omnidirectional, uniform linear array (ULA) microphone elements are located at a distance of 𝜆 = 𝑑/4 from each other, the output of each of these microphones is sent to a separate FIR filter with length n = 12 is given (connected)
 The demand of the problem (1): Get these filters and other components (parameters) so that its directional pattern (beam pattern) at the angle 𝜃𝑡 = 0° receives the white noise with the maximum benefit (WNG is the maximum at that angle) and remove the two disturbing signals that are entering the array from the angles of 𝜃𝑡 = 35° and 𝜃𝑡 = 47° and can also have the most similar performance in two frequencies 𝑓1 and 𝑓2?
